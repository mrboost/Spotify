Step one.. Visit https://spotify.aidenwallis.co.uk/ Once you login in, you will be brought to a page. At the top of the page you will see "Your user ID is:" Followed by a string of numbers. Copy these numbers because you will need this key for the widget

Step Two.. On Streamlabs, go to "All Widgets", then "Viewer Count" (or any that you dont use) and copy and paste each one of the fields. IE (HTML, CSS, JS, FIELDS).

Step Three.. Paste your code you copied from earlier into the "Spotify Key" feild.

Step Four... Rock out!
